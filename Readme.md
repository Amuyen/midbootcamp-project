# Creditcard project

In this project I was assigned a dataset of a bank customers and the respective data that a bank may have in file.

The business case is one built to try to precit if a customer will accept a credit card offer.

As the mere prediction is not would not be in the best interest, the idea would be for the bank 

After plotting the percentage of acceptance for each column I decided to make a presentation to answer  the following questions, which are pretty well answered with the tableau presentation:

- Which information gathered client have a clear indication in predicting if client will accept the credit card offer?

income level, credit rating, but these are cntrary to what the bank is looking for.

- What influence does average balance have on deciding whether to accept the offer?

None, but it may influence if the bank will make the offer as a higher average balance may be indication of liquidity.

- What are some strategies that the bank can use to improve its acceptance rate?

Send postcards as mailers for the offers, improve the air-miles reward program.

- What type of households might the bank try to focus in the customer acquisition for new offers?

HOuseholds of 3 or less.
