# Creditcard project

In this project I was assigned a dataset of a bank customers and the respective data that a bank may have in file.

The business case is one built to try to predict if a customer will accept a credit card offer.

As the mere prediction is not would not be in the best interest, the idea would be for the bank to focus business strategy on the predictions to get a higher return on investment for customer acquisitoins

As it seems that the repo did not contain the business quesitions necessary for the project, I decided to create my own quesionts based on the work done on the dataset.

After plotting the percentage of acceptance for each column I decided to make a presentation to answer  the following questions, which are pretty well answered with the tableau presentation:

- Which information gathered client have a clear indication in predicting if client will accept the credit card offer?

income level, credit rating, but these are cntrary to what the bank is looking for.

- What influence does average balance have on deciding whether to accept the offer?

None, but it may influence if the bank will make the offer as a higher average balance may be indication of liquidity.

- What are some strategies that the bank can use to improve its acceptance rate?

Send postcards as mailers for the offers, improve the air-miles reward program.

- What type of households might the bank try to focus in the customer acquisition for new offers?

HOuseholds of 3 or less.
